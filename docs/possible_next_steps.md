# 📄 Next Steps: OCR Integration in My Accounting App


## ✅ What I Already Do

- 🧾 Extract text from uploaded receipts (JPEG, PNG).
- ✍️ Use OCR output to pre-fill basic form fields like description or amount.

---

## 🚀 What I Want to Do Next

### 🔍 Smarter Invoice Field Extraction
I want to automatically identify and extract key fields like:
- Invoice number
- Supplier name
- Date of purchase
- VAT rates and totals (TTC / HT)
- Payment terms

I’ll use regex and positional context to detect these elements more reliably.

---

### 🧠 Automatic Supplier Matching
Based on the OCR text:
- I'll suggest matching suppliers from the database.
- If no match is found, I'll offer to create a new supplier entry using the extracted text (name, SIRET, VAT number, etc).

---

### 🔁 Receipt Deduplication
To prevent double entries:
- I'll hash the OCR text content.
- If a similar receipt was already uploaded, I’ll flag it as a possible duplicate.

---

### 🧾 PDF Bill Parsing
Many bills come as PDFs. I want to:
- Convert PDF pages to images.
- Run OCR on each page.
- Extract text and structure as with image files.

---

### 💶 VAT Compliance Checks
To assist with French/EU accounting requirements:
- I’ll validate VAT format (e.g. `FR12345678901`)
- Cross-check stated VAT rate with expected supplier country rates
- Raise alerts if there are inconsistencies

---

### 🗂️ Batch Scanning / Multi-Upload
I'd like to support:
- Uploading multiple files (zip or drag-and-drop)
- Running OCR on each
- Pre-filling a batch of expenses all at once

---

### 🔐 Fraud or Anomaly Detection
To improve trust and accuracy:
- I could compare OCR data to manually entered data
- Flag discrepancies (e.g. bill amount ≠ OCR amount)
- Log unusual document structures or modified fields

---

### 🔎 Searchable OCR Text Archive
I want users to be able to:
- Search for specific words in receipt content
- Filter expenses with OCR-indexed keywords (e.g. "restaurant", "Amazon", "Achat de licence")

---

### 📱 Mobile Photo-to-Expense Flow
Eventually, I want to:
- Let users take a picture of a bill from their phone
- Upload directly via web/mobile interface
- Auto-fill expense form using OCR

---

### 🌍 Multilingual Support
If users deal with foreign suppliers:
- I can enable OCR in other languages like Spanish, German, Italian
- Use language hints or let users specify expected language

---

## 🧪 Bonus Ideas

- Use NLP (Named Entity Recognition) to detect:
  - Company names
  - Dates
  - Places
- Train a classifier to auto-categorize expenses (e.g. “Meal”, “Software”, “Travel”).
